My name is Kindi BALDE. I'm a Full Stack Data Scientist, AI Enthusiast, and Consultant based in Paris, France.

From an Econometrics academic background, I worked my way up to Data Science by expanding my passion for data analysis. Through that process, I went from simple data analysis to advanced data engineering in distributed ecosystems like Hadoop and Spark, and now to Artificial Intelligence. 

My area of interest is augmented intelligence and synthetic data. I believe in the continuous development of smart machines to help humans in their daily tasks. I am a little skeptical about AGI.  

I work tirelessly to promote open and reproducible science, learning by doing and openly publishing my work on GitHub and online blog platforms whenever I can.
